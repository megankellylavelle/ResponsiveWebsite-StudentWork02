		<h1>EduSkate</h1>
		<p><strong>San Francisco Skate Club's After School Program</strong><br>
	
"Eduskate" at the SF Skate Club Hub has the capacity to serve 15 middle school students, Monday-Friday, from 2-6:30pm. Children will be supervised and supported by SF Skate Club program leaders, including credentialed teacher, Thuy Nguyen (Master's of Arts in Teaching) and Shawn Connolly, professional skater, filmmaker, and mixed-media artist.
As a small program with a 2 (often 3) to 15 ratio of adults to children, SF Skate Club nurtures caring, mentor-like relationships with its youth and offers quality programming shaped by the voices, experiences, and interests of everyone in its community.
Moreover, SF Skate Club collaborates with youth serving organizations and schools, such as Booker T. Washington Community Services Center and McKinley Elementary to develop educational programs, build community and increase access to resources for our youth.</p>
